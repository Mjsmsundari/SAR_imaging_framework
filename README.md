# SAR_imaging_framework

This software allows users to generate SAR images of submarine wakes, facilitating the creation of synthetic SAR dataset.

# Software description:

1. The software simulates the SAR images of submarine wakes in Indian Ocean region and Mediterranean Sea.
2. Then, the wake patterns of three Indian classes submarines can be generated with the operating speeds of 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, and 5 Knots and at diving depths of 10, 20, and 30 meters.
3. Adjusting the sensing parameters makes it feasible to model the SAR images of submarine wakes under various radar scanning environments.
4. Users can export final SAR image files using the export facility.
